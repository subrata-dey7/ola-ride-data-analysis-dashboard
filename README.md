## Overview:

This project analyzes **OLA ride booking performance for July 2024** with a focus on overall ride volume, revenue generation cancellation trends, customer and driver behaviour, and vehicle type performance.

**Key highlights include:**

- **1,03,024 total bookings**, contributing to a **total booking value of 35M**
- **62.09% successful rides** (‚âà63,967 bookings), with a **cancellation rate of 28.08%**.
- Major **cancellation reasons** were by drivers (Personal and Car related issue - 35.49%) and by customers (Driver is not moving towards pickup location - 30.24%).
- **Revenue primarily came from Cash (19.3M, 55.1%) and UPI (14.2M, 40.6%)**, showing more cash payment adoption but continued reliance on digital payment.
- **Prime Sedan, E-bikes and Auto categories** contributed significantly to Success booking values, but **Auto categories** showed **lower distance coverage**.
- Customer and driver ratings across all vehicle types remained stable at ~4.0 (Approx), indicating overall service satisfaction.

These findings emphasize the need to reduce cancellations, optimize revenue channels, and improve service delivery across vehicle categories.

### 1. Introduction

The growth of ride-hailing services has transformed urban mobility. OLA, as one of the leaders in this sector, needs continuous performance monitoring to optimize customer satisfaction, minimize cancellations, and maximize revenue. This project focuses on a **monthly operational analysis (July 2024)**
to provide actionable insights.

### 2. Objectives and Scope

**Objectives:**

- Quantify overall ride bookings and value.
- Identify leading causes and rates for ride cancellations.
- Assess vehicle type performance against booking, revenue, and ratings.
- Evaluate payment method trends and top customer segments.
- Pinpoint actionable drivers for business improvement.

**Scope:**

- Time frame: **1st July 2024 ‚Äì 31st July 2024**.
- Covers booking data, cancellations, revenues, and ratings.
- Does not include external market comparisons or competitor data.

### 3. Data Description

- **Source:** OLA internal ride-booking dataset (Internet).
- **Period:** July 1‚Äì31, 2024.
- **Data Points:**  
    a) Total bookings and value.  
    b) Status breakdown: success, driver cancelled, customer cancelled, driver not found.  
    c) Vehicle type details: booking value, success rate, distance.  
    d) Payment methods and revenue.  
    e) Cancellation reasons (driver vs. customer).  
    f) Ratings (customer and driver).

### 4. Methodology

### 6. Insights and Interpretation

- **High cancellation rate (28.08%)** is a key area of concern, driven largely by **driver cancellations**. This directly affects revenue and customer trust.
- **Cash** remains the **dominant payment mode**, signalling limited penetration of digital payments.
- **Vehicle types contribute evenly**, but Prime Sedan, E-Bike and Autos have stronger performance in terms of Success Booking value.
- **Ratings stability (~4.0)** suggests customer satisfaction is maintained but could be improved with better reliability.
- **Successful booking** rates are healthy, **above 60%** (could be improved).
- No significant customer dissatisfaction observed by vehicle rating averages.

**Compared with industry benchmarks:**

- Ola‚Äôs cancellation rate (28.08%) is elevated compared to competitors, where typical rates are below 20%.
- Average customer and driver ratings are on par with market standards.


### 7. Recommendations  

- **Reduce Driver Cancellations**  

    a) Incentivize drivers for accepting and completing rides.  
    b) Improve vehicle health support programs (maintenance, emergency support).

- **Customer Retention**

    a) Introduce better cancellation policies and loyalty rewards for repeat users.  
    b) Improve map/address accuracy to minimize "wrong address" cancellations.

- **Revenue Optimization**

    a) Promote UPI and Credit Card usage with cashback schemes (reducing dependency on cash).  
    b) Leverage data-driven offers for high-value customers.

- **Service Quality Enhancement**

    a) Introduce real-time driver training modules.  
    b) Maintain vehicle and driver performance tracking for quality control.

- Experiment with dynamic routing and pricing to mitigate ‚Äòdriver not moving‚Äô cancellations.

- Implement AI-driven dispatch solutions to optimize customer-driver matching.


### 8. Conclusion

The analysis of July 2024 OLA bookings reveals strong revenue generation (35M) but high cancellation rates (28%) remain a challenge. While customer satisfaction is steady, reducing cancellations and optimizing payment strategies are critical to sustaining growth. Future work should focus on predictive modelling of cancellations and personalized service offerings to enhance overall performance.
